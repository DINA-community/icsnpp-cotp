# ICSNPP-COTP

Industrial Control Systems Network Protocol Parsers (ICSNPP) - Connection-Oriented Transport Protocol (COTP)

## Overview

This plugin provides a protocol analyzer for the OSI Connection-Oriented Transport Protocol (COTP) (ISO 8073
/ X.224) for use within Zeek.

## Dependencies

COTP is dependent on [TPKT](https://github.com/DINA-community/icsnpp-tpkt),
which must also be installed.
In addition, zeek must support spicy.

## Installation

### Package Manager

This script is available as a package for [Zeek Package Manager](https://docs.zeek.org/projects/package-manager/en/stable/index.html).

```bash
zkg refresh
zkg install cotp
```

If this package is installed from ZKG, it will be added to the available plugins. This can be tested by running `zeek -NN`. If installed correctly, users will see `ANALYZER_COTP` under the list of plugins.

If users have ZKG configured to load packages (see `@load packages` in the( [ZKG Quickstart Guide](https://docs.zeek.org/projects/package-manager/en/stable/quickstart.html)), this plugin and these scripts will automatically be loaded and ready to go.)
